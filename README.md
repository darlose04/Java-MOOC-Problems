# Java MOOC Problems

This repository contains the files for the Java problems I have completed while going through the University of Helsinki Java MOOC. Much of this work is not mine, such as the testing and set up files, but the solved problems are my work. 

I completed this work while in a Linux environment. I am currently working on learning C# and want to go through these same problems with C# while working in Windows. So I think just putting it all on Github makes referencing the problems a little easier.
